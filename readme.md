# Istio on Openshift

This write up covers my notes on running Istio on OpenShift. As I test with different implementations of OpenShift, I'll add additional links here.

## Deploying Istio

* [Deploying Istio with `oc cluster up`](./DeployingIstioWithOcclusterup.md)
* Deploying Istio with minishift
* Deploying Istio with OpenShift Cluster

## Infrastructure components on Istio
* [Deploy infrastructure components for metrics and tracing](./InstallInfrastructureComponents.md)

## Sample Application and Testing
